Do as instructed in @instructions.md 
for leaason 7: @07/processed_data/07.md 

Make sure that the grammar section includes every grammar topic explicitly taught in the lesson.

You can aslo expand the vocabulary tables (a bit) where useful—still keeping all Finnish items strictly from the lesson text.

Dont do any other steps. Just this one.
